        <p>
          I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently specialized in the Elixir
          programming language and the BEAM runtime. I have experience building
          and maintaining backend systems in complex domains, and I have a strong
          interest in the development of tools and libraries to help other developers
          to build more maintainable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I volunteer as a moderator for the
          <a href="https://discord.gg/elixir" target="_blank" rel="noopener
          noreferrer">Elixir Discord server</a>, where we provide assistance to
          other members of the Elixir community ranging from beginners to
          experts working on large scale projects. I'm the author of the <a href="https://github.com/doorgan/sourceror"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sourceror</a> library for AST-based Elixir
          source code manipulation, which helps to solve the long lasting issue
          of the lack of refactoring tools in the Elixir ecosystem.

              I developed and maintained the backend and realtime systems for the
              Felt mapping application. I also developed the Felt API to allow developers
              to programatically interact with the maps, and built the foundations for
              the live connections to external data sources. During this time I also
              developed tooling to help the team to maintain the codebase, like

              I maintained and improved a legacy Elixir and JavaScript/React
              codebase for the coordination of manufacturing and logistics of
              custom packaging solutions. I participated in all stages of
              product and feature development, from idea, to design, to
              implementation and deployment. I also regularly engaged in several
              investigations about complex domain problems and urgent/critical
              bug fixing. My work also involved the constant evaluation of
              access patterns to optimize our usage of the PostgreSQL database.

            <p>
              Sourceror is a toolkit to work with the Elixir source code. It's
              the first library in the Elixir ecosystem that empowers
              Elixirists and tool authors to build refactoring tools and
              migration scripts, similar to what jscodeshift has to offer
              for the JavaScript world. It provides an annotated Abstract
              Syntax Tree for the Elixir language, and a fork of the Elixir
              parser to backport features I contributed to Elixir 1.13 to
              older Elixir versions.

            <p>
              I contributed a series of pull requests to core Elixir to enable programmatic manipulation
              of the source code. Through PRs
              <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/10990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                title="Expose internal representation of comments">#10990</a> and <a

                title="Implement a normalizer that translates regular AST to a special, annotated version of the AST">#10988</a>
              I helped solve the lack of the primitives required to build refactoring tools, an issue that was affecting
              the whole community since the early days of the language, in an incremental an backwards compatible way.

              Embers was an exploratory project to build a social network
              platform built from the ground up with Elixir and the Phoenix
              Framework, where users could share a variety of multimedia content
              with their followers. Some of its features included a personal feed
              updated in real time, a private messaging system, real-time
              notifications, and asymmetric tracking of online presences.

                I have been using the Elixir language since 2018, and I volunteer
                teaching and helping solve problems to other members of the Elixir
                community. I have a very solid understanding of the AST representation of
                the Elixir code and how to use it to build macros and tools, which
                is the area I'm currently working on in the Open Source space.
                I understand the fundamentals of the OTP like GenServers,
                supervision trees and single node concurrency, which are the
                features of the language that I leveraged to keep my projects
                stack simple and manageable.

                I have been using JavaScript for 5+ years for personal
                projects. I have good understanding of ES6+ features,
                Promises, and event loop macro/micro tasks. I have experience
                with Parcel and Snowpack build tools, Vue 2, Solid and Svelte
                frameworks, React hooks inspired libraries, and state
                management patterns like Meiosis, which I used to build my

                I've been using PostgreSQL since 2018, when I migrated away
                from MySQL. I have experience setting up indexes to speed up
                queries, on setting up constraints at the database level
                instead of relying on application level validations, and I
                have basic knowledge of
                <code>EXPLAIN</code> queries to find inefficiencies in query
                plans.
